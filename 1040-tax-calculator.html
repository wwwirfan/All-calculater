This amount is normally reported to you on form 1099-DIV. Qualified dividends are the portion of your total ordinary dividends subject to the lower capital gains tax rate. Qualified dividends are typically dividends paid by a corporation in which you own stock (or a mutual fund that owns stock in the corporation). <p>Qualified dividends also have a minimum holding period of the underlying stock. For common stock dividends to be considered qualified dividends, you need to have owned the stock for at least 60 days during a 121 day period that starts 60 days before the ex-dividend date. The same rule applies for preferred stock but the holding period is 90 days during a 181-day period starting 90 days before the ex-dividend date. <p>Stock you own directly, not through a mutual fund or exchange traded fund, will report qualified dividends without regard to your holding period. If you bought or sold the stock during the year, you will need to determine if your ownership of the underlying stock meets the holding requirement. <p>Mutual funds and exchange traded funds will report qualified dividends with regard to their holding period of a stock owned by the fund. However, if you bought or sold fund shares during the year you will need to apply the same holding requirements to fund shares you own (or owned) as you would to a common stock. If you do not meet the holding requirement, qualified dividends reported to you by your fund should not be included as qualified dividends on your tax return.</dd></div> <div id='KJE-D-LINE_10_TAXABLE_REFUNDS_OR_CREDITS_OF_STATE_AND_LOCAL_INCOME_TAXES'><dt>Taxable refunds of state and local income taxes</dt><dd>If you did not itemize your deductions in the previous year, or you itemized deductions but elected to include sales taxes (instead of income taxes) this amount will be $0 regardless of any refund you received.
